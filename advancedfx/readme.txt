Installation:

You need to install latest Blender Source Tools first
( http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/ ),
since we depend on it.
This version of afx-blender-scripts was tested using
Blender Source Tools 3.1.0.

If you have a previous version of afx-blender-scripts installed, uninstall
it first through Blender!

afx-blender-scripts is installed like the Blender Source Tools are.

Of course when using AGR import you need the decompiled(player) models
in a folder structure like it is in CS:GO's pak01_dir.pak
We recommend Crowbar ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool )
and YOU NEED TO TICK THE "Folder for each model" option in the Decompile
options!



Usage:

Always make sure to select the correct render properties in your project first
(FPS, resolution).

The scripts can be accessed through entries in the import menu and export menu.

"Add interpolated key frames" option:
Default is off (disabled).
This creates interpolated key frames for Blender frames in-between the original
key frames. This is useful in case your Blender project FPS doesn't match your
recorded FPS, because interpolation is set to constant between all keyframes
(see notice bellow for reason).
Of course this will add more data and take longer if that's the case when you
enable it.

Don't forget to enter the "Asset Path" when using AGR import, it needs to be
the full path to the folder structure with the decompiled models.
We recommend using Crowbar ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool )
and YOU NEED TO TICK THE "Folder for each model" option in the Decompile
options!

Notice:
The interpolation is set to CONSTANT for everything, because
Blender doesn't support proper interpolation of curves for quaternions yet.

- Minor changes

1.7.0 (2019-01-26T14:18Z):
- Updated to Blender 2.80 beta (needs latest Blender Source Tools 2.11.0b1-3251fc47b768116b91a8f5550166bc5ccb01efdf or newer ( https://github.com/Artfunkel/BlenderSourceTools/tree/master/io_scene_valvesource )).
- Fixed HLAE BVH Export exporting wrong rotation.

1.6.0 (2018-10-05T17:45Z):
- Update HLAE AGR Import:
  - Added option "Bones (skeleton) only", thanks to https://github.com/Darkhandrob

1.5.1 (2018-08-16T08:24Z):
- Update HLAE Camera IO (.cam) export:
  - Fixed it not working when camera object name did not match camera object data name

1.5.0 (2018-04-27T17:11Z):
- Added HLAE Camera IO (.cam) import
- Added HLAE Camera IO (.cam) export
- Update HLAE AGR Import:
  - Added option "Add interpolated key frames" (default off)

  - Added option "Add interpolated key frames" (default off)
  - Bug fixes
- Updated HLAE BVH Export:
  - Renamed to HLAE old Cam IO (.bvh) export
  - Bug fixes
- Tested with Blender Source Tools 2.10.2
- Please see updated usage note above regarding
  "Add interpolated key frames"

1.4.3 (2017-12-23T21:14Z):
- Updated HLAE AGR Import:
  Added option "Preserve SMD Polygons & Normals":
  Import raw (faster), disconnected polygons from SMD files;
  these are harder to edit but a closer match to the original mesh.
  (Enabled by default, much less time spent on importing models now.)

1.4.2 (2017-11-18T20:00Z):
- Updated HLAE AGR Import: Added option "Scale invisible to zero"
  to scale entities to 0 upon hide_render (might be useful for FBX export).
  This option creates drivers and modifiers on each entity,
  so no extra animation data.
  Please don't be scared if at frame 0 (default) everything is scaled to
  zero (not visible), this is because the animations start at frame 1.

1.4.1 (2017-11-01T18:53Z):
- Updated HLAE AGR Import: Now will only work with the "Folder for each model"
  Option in Crowbar. This is important to avoid naming collissions that can occur.
  In return this also works with the newest Crowbar version (currently 0.49.0).

  rotation of the models between two keyframes.

1.0.1 (2016-08-10T12:48Z):
